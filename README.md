# no-pv-export
Design a System that helps in keeping pv export as low as possible by using it to power local demands

# Preface
The production-rate of pv-generators(pv-panels) is closely tied to the radiation of the sun and therefore more or less predictable. To use as mutch of the generated power and thus reduce the excess exported into the grid is the goal of this repository.

# Requirements
To achieve the aforementioned goal of reducing return to grid, the following features have to be present. The order of occurence is not tied to the order of relevance

1. Determining current production, use and return to grid
2. Predict Short-term(1-minute range) and Mid-term(1-hour range) of return to grid
3. Stear "fixed" size loads
4. Regulate variable size loads
5. Visualization of short-term values and long-term statistics
